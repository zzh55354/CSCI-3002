Group 2 – Project Plan Part 1: Group plan
Team members: Ziheng Zhu (team liason) Zitao Cheng
Revised project description:
The project that our group is going to do is “Let read more book”. Our initial idea of this project is to create an app that can recommend books to users and let them read. We come up with two main functionalities that this app can able to do. The first one is by searching the key words, users are able to see the relative books’ title that showed up on the app. The second one is according to users’ browsing content on the device, the app can base on that to recommend books to the users. For example, one person may watch lots of cuisine teaching video on YouTube, then the apps should able to recommend some kinds of cookery book to this guy. Since the second functionality is hard to implement, our project idea may be adjusted in some points.
